<h1>Tiramisu Pots</h1>
<h3>Serves 6</h3>
<p>For this cheats's tiramisu, I used condenced milk in a mascarpone cream rather than eggs, which would be more tradtional but also more time-consuming. The milk brings a silky sweetness that goes beautifly with the chocolate, and it still ticks all the boxes for texture and flavor. If you're entertaining, make these ahead of time and leave them in the fridge until you are ready to serve.</p>

  <br>
  <li>Remove the coffee from the freezer. If it's still not cold, add a couple of ice cubes to the tray and stir until cool. Take 9 of the ladyfigures and soak them one at a time in the coffee for a few seconds. Break the soaked ladyfingures in half and divide them amoung the bottoms of the six serving glasses.</li>
